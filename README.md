# Python Platformer Game

This is a basic platformer game built using PyGame. I was curious about game development since I'd never done a project of this kind before so this was a very fun first attempt.

I'm currently working on updating it to a version with some more levels so keep an eye out for that!
Feel free to play it on your own machine (and maybe even add some levels of your own!).

Here's a quick demo of what it currently looks like:
